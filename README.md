# Snake Game in Haskell

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game written in Haskell.  
The project is purely recreational and aims to improve my programming skills while exploring functional programming concepts.
i followed alot of @tfausak did in  https://github.com/tfausak/haskell-snake-game check it out
## Features
- Control the snake using keyboard inputs.
- Grow the snake by collecting food.
- Game over when the snake collides with itself or the walls.
